# CS170Project

My project contains various solvers. To replicate my results run python/solve_all.py on all of my solvers: solve_naive, solve_greedy, solve_random, solve_LPmin, solve_LPnum, solve_LPmax, solve_LP3, solve_LP2, solve_LP4, solve_LP5, and solve_LP6. Then, use merge.py to combine them all into one folder.

NOTE: The results you get may not be exactly the same ones I got, but most numbers should be pretty close

NOTE: The LP solvers do take a while to run on large inputs. LP6 takes ESPECIALLY long, but usually gives the best results.
